django-crucrudile [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pstch/django-crucrudile.svg?branch=crucrudile)](https://travis-ci.org/pstch/django-crucrudile) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/pstch/django-crucrudile/badge.png?branch=crucrudile)](https://coveralls.io/r/pstch/django-crucrudile?branch=crucrudile)
=================

Current version is `1.0.0-rc1`. `django-crucrudile` is available in PyPI : https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-crucrudile/

`django-crucrudile` is currently only compatible with Python 3 (tested with 3.3 and 3.4). Backporting to Python 2 should be pretty easy (there are no Python 3 "exclusive" features used), and help is welcome for this simple, repetitive task.

Python 2 compatibility is expected for `1.1.0`.

**NOTE :** Development is done on the `develop` branch, and when releasing a new version, merged into the `master` branch

## Documentation

The documentation, available at https://django-crucrudile.readthedocs.org/en/latest/, is automatically created from the docstrings present in the source code, using Sphinx (and some extensions).

## Contributing

If you feel like you want to contribute to this project, please fork/send patches/submit pull requests ! The documentation and tests really need some improvement. This was my first time writing serious test cases, and my testing code is particularly ugly :(

Project coding guidelines are still TODO.
