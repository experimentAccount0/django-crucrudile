django-crucrudile [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pstch/django-crucrudile.svg?branch=crucrudile)](https://travis-ci.org/pstch/django-crucrudile) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/pstch/django-crucrudile/badge.png?branch=crucrudile)](https://coveralls.io/r/pstch/django-crucrudile?branch=crucrudile)
=================

**WARNING :** This project is still a WIP. The implementation of the concept is stable, and I already use it in my own projects, but it will still take some times before I can release a proper version (somewhen in April 2014).

**NOTE :** Development is done on the `develop` branch, and when needed, merged into the `master` branch, which is more stable. **Code on the `develop` branch may not work at all !** (Which doesn't mean that the code on the `master` branch will work..)

## Documentation

The documentation, available at [django-crucrudile.readthedocs.org](http://django-crucrudile.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), is automatically created from the docstrings present in the source code, using Sphinx (and some extensions).

## Example

TODO

## Tests

`django-crucrudile` usually has a 100% code coverage, as its internals aren't really complicated. You can watch the latest results of the tests on [Travis-CI/pstch/django-crucrudile](https://travis-ci.org/pstch/django-crucrudile).

## Getting help

This is my first attempt at creating a (hopefully) useful Django application. If you're trying it out, and need some help, feel free to contact me at hugo@pstch.net ! Really, this will make me really happy :)

## Contributing

If you feel like you want to contribute to this project, please fork/send patches/submit pull requests ! The documentation and tests really need some improvement. This was my first time writing serious test cases, and my testing code is particularly ugly :(
