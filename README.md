django-crucrudile [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pstch/django-crucrudile.svg?branch=crucrudile)](https://travis-ci.org/pstch/django-crucrudile) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/pstch/django-crucrudile/badge.png?branch=crucrudile)](https://coveralls.io/r/pstch/django-crucrudile?branch=crucrudile)
=================

Current release is `0.9.3`.

**NOTE :** Development is done on the `develop` branch, and when needed, merged into the `master` branch, which is more stable. **Code on the `develop` branch may not work at all !** (Which doesn't mean that the code on the `master` branch will work..)

## Documentation

The documentation, available at [django-crucrudile.readthedocs.org](http://django-crucrudile.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), is automatically created from the docstrings present in the source code, using Sphinx (and some extensions).

### Examples

## Contributing

If you feel like you want to contribute to this project, please fork/send patches/submit pull requests ! The documentation and tests really need some improvement. This was my first time writing serious test cases, and my testing code is particularly ugly :(

Project coding guidelines are still TODO.
