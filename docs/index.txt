django-crucrudile
=================

``django-crucrudile`` allows you to create **model mixins**, that define possible **actions** for this **model**. Those model mixins allow the model to be able to generate **its own URL patterns** by itself, so that they can be included in ``urls.py`` using just a call to the ``get_url_patterns()`` method of the model class.
